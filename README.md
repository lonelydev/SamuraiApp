# Entity Framework Core

EF Core is a lightweight, extensible open source and crossplatform version 
of the popular entity framework data access technology.

It serves as an object-relational mapper (ORM), enabling .NET developers to work
with a database using .NET objects, and eliminating the need for most of the data-access 
code they usually need to write. 

## What's in this repository?

This repository is composed of a SamuraiApp, a console app to demonstrate how we can easily
create a database using database migrations and models defined in C# using entity framework 
Core. 

It also covers the differences between EF Core and EF 6. 
  * The differences between database migrations 
  * The handling of entity relationships
etc.

Thanks to Julie Lerman's course, I now know of EF Core Powertools, which helps to generate 
entity model diagrams that display how the model looks like even before creating the database
depicting the many-many and one-one relationships clearly.
